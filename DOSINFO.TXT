1- Background and main features
==============================================================================

DosInfo is a neofetch clone for DOS. Neofetch was a very popular command-line 
system information tool mainly for Linux (no longer maintained). There are a
couple of DOS alternatives already but those require 386+ CPUs or didn't have
the options I would like to see.

After seeing a post on Vogons where userJo22 mentioned dosfetch I became 
curious and saw that the sources were available as well. As I did some Turbo 
Pascal programming when I started my career I jumped on it and added the 
checks and options I wanted. In the process it became a complete rewrite and 
almost none of the code for checks etc of dosfetch is used anymore.

Further information about dosfetch can be found on their Github page
(https://github.com/leahneukirchen/dosfetch/tree/master).

Improvements from dosfetch include:

Added and improved checks:

 - Added XMS/EMS size
 - Added free base memory
 - Added CPU family info (including MMX/SSE/SSE2 if available)
 - OS detection improved (added Dosbox, Dosbox-X etc)
 - Added uptime (works with leap years etc for unrealistic long uptimes :))
 - Now also works with FAT32 drives
 - Shows all available drives
 - Auto detects < 80 column displays and adjusts the output

Added options:

 - Logo is changeable (with a text file)
 - Includes a /nologo switch if you don't want to show a logo
 - Colors can be changed (with a config file)

Removed some bugs (like OS version for older DOS versions) and added some 
sanity checks (line length etc).

2- Usage, options and examples
==============================================================================

Getting help is easy. Just use /?, /help or whatever parameter which is not 
defined. For example:

DOSINFO.EXE /?

Which gives you all available option. Here is an example of the output:

DosInfo, version 0.8.1
Copyright 2025 (c) by Yoghoo

Usage: DosInfo [options]
  /create          -- Create uptime counter file and run the program
  /nologo          -- Run the program without showing a logo
  /nologo /create  -- Create uptime counter file and run program without logo
  /noshow          -- Create uptime counter file but don't run the program
  /remove          -- Remove uptime counter file

Start with no parameters to run the program normally.

Best way to start DosInfo is to put it at the end of your autoexec.bat. For 
example add this line (change path if necessary):

C:\UTILS\DOSINFO.EXE /CREATE

Or if you don't want any output when starting the computer but want to get 
accurate uptime information:

C:\UTILS\DOSINFO.EXE /NOSHOW

Afterwards you can just run DOSINFO.EXE without parameters.

3- Check explanation
==============================================================================

CPU: This will display the CPU family including MMX/SSE/SSE2 if available. For
486SX and lower it will also show if a coprocessor is available or not. As 
there are a LOT of CPUs released by many vendors over the years there will 
probably be some misdetections especially with more recent CPUs. In theory 
it should detect CPUs until around 2021.

OS: This returns the output from the ver command. This can contain something
like "Windows 98 [version number]", "4DOS 7,50 DR DOS 6,00" etc. If running 
DOSBox or DOSBox-X it will show that instead.

Dos Version: This will return the reported DOS version. This can be the same
as the OS check when running a clean MS DOS 6.22 installation without 4DOS,
NDOS for example. But for other DOS alternatives like DR DOS 6.0 it will 
return for example IBM DOS 3.31. This can be important when running certain 
games or applications.

Base Memory: This will report the total base memory value and how much free
base memory is available.

XMS/EMS Memory: This will report the total amount of XMS and EMS memory (if
available). It will not report the amount of free XMS/EMS. This was a design
decision because of the limited space and I'd rather see total instead of 
free.

Disk: This will show the used space and total size of the current disk. It 
will also show the percentage used. This works on FAT32 drives as well.

Drives: This will show all available drive (floppy/disk drives, CD-ROMs 
etc). If you have more then around 10 drives defined it will be cut off at
the end and will only show the first 10 drives. This is done to prevent 
corrupt screen output.

Uptime: This will show how long the computer is running. As this will account
for leap years etc as well it is able to show very long uptimes. Probably
unrealistic for a DOS machine nowadays but it's possible. :) For this to work
it's necessary to run DOSINFO.EXE /CREATE or DOSINFO.EXE /CREATE /NOSHOW when 
the computer starts. This will save the start time and date to a file. 
Unfortunately there is no reliable way to get this information in another way.

4- Logo and colors
==============================================================================

It's possible to change the logo and colors if you don't like the defaults.

On Github (https://github.com/Yoghoo/DosInfo) there are two files to change 
this. 

DOSINFO.LGO contains an example logo which you can change to your liking. Keep
in mind that it should be at most 8 lines with each line containing 40 
characters or less. All extra lines and characters above that limit will not
be used.

DOSINFO.CFG contains the colors you want to use. The first 5 lines are used
for the colors. The first 3 colors are for the 3 columns of the logo. The 4th
is for the description of the check. The last one is for the value of the 
check. Below the 5 lines is a complete description of all colors that can
used. These extra lines can be removed without problems if needed.

Keep the filenames as is and put them in the same directory where DOSINFO.EXE
resides.

5- Tested systems
==============================================================================

DosInfo is tested on computers with NEC V20  CPUs and newer (until Pentium 
II). In Dosbox-X it also runs on a 8088 CPU but this is not tested on actual 
hardware yet. 

Also a lot of DOS OSes were tested. Some examples are MS-DOS 2.0, 3.31, 6.22,
DR-DOS 6.0, Novell DOS 7.0, IBM PC DOS 7.0 and FreeDOS 1.4.
